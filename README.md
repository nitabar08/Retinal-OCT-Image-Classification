# Project Title: Retinal OCT Image Classification

**Description:**
This project involves the classification of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using a deep learning model. The goal is to accurately identify four different categories of retinal conditions: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes image augmentation and normalization.
- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.
- **Training and Validation:** The model is trained on a labeled dataset and validated to ensure accuracy and generalization.
- **Class Mapping:** Numerical class predictions are mapped to human-readable labels.
- **Output:** The predicted labels are saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebook to train the model and generate predictions.

**Results:**
The project successfully classifies retinal OCT images into the specified categories with high accuracy.
